# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and design of a simple calculator application built with Flutter. The app provides basic arithmetic operations, a clean user interface, and is designed to be easily extensible.

## Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Clear and Delete:** Users can clear the entire input or delete the last character.
*   **Percentage:** Users can convert the current number to a percentage.
*   **Responsive UI:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## File Structure

*   `lib/main.dart`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `lib/calculator_screen.dart`: The main screen of the calculator, containing the UI and logic.
*   `lib/button_values.dart`: A file that defines the values for the calculator buttons.

## Design

*   **Theme:** The app uses a dark theme for a modern look and feel.
*   **Layout:** The calculator has a simple and intuitive layout, with the display at the top and the buttons at the bottom.
*   **Buttons:** The buttons are color-coded to distinguish between different types of operations.
